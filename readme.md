- **Products page**
<br />The Comfy Store Products Page offers a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for browsing a wide range of household items. The page features an intuitive search bar that allows users to easily find products by various criteria such as company and price. Users can also search by typing in the search box, which is also available.
When users hover over a product image, two interactive buttons appear to enhance the browsing process. The first button redirects to the productâ€™s dedicated page, where users can view more detailed information about the item. The second button adds the product to the cart, allowing users to quickly save items for purchase. This hover feature makes exploring and selecting products even more efficient.
